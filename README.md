# vendingMachine
Replication of a vending machine

This project builds on the foundations explored in DVD library, i.e implements a full MVC approach hence easily allows for infinetly scalable complexity.

Key ideas:

Dependency injection including Spring annotations,
coding to interfaces,
Unit tests (including creating stubs),
Reading and writing data to a file where necessary (including an audit file),
Creation of project specific exceptions,
Functionality being handled in the service layer,
use of Enums,
use of Streams and Lambda functions.
